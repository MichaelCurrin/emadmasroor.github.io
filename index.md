<img src="https://emadmasroor.github.io/assets/emad4.webp" width="256" height="256" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;"/> I'm a PhD candidate in the [Engineering Mechanics program](https://beam.vt.edu/graduate/mechanics.html) at Virginia Tech, where I have been since spring 2018, working with Dr. Mark Stremler.

Engineering Mechanics lies at the intersection of the _applied_ world of civil and mechanical engineering on the one hand, and the _theoretical_ world of physics and mathematics on the other. In particular, I study *fluid mechanics*: the science of fluids in motion. You can find out more about my current projects on the [research](/Research) page. 

I'm passionate about teaching, and aside from my work as a TA at Virginia Tech, I also teach Engineering Problem Solving to middle school students at the [Duke Talent Identification Program](https://tip.duke.edu/) at Davidson, NC during the summer. We learn calculus and trig, build slingshots, bridges and circuits, and have a blast!
