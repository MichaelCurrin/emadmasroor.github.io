## Vortex-induced vibrations
Vortex-induced vibrations form a key part of the interaction between fluids and solids in the natural as well as man-made world. Fluid-structure interaction is responsible for much of the complexity of fluid flows.
I am working on an experimental study of the wake behind a circular cylinder oscillating transversely to a uniform flow. The experiments are conducted in a gravity-driven, inclined soap film channel which produces a two-dimensional flow that can be visualized with a high-speed camera.

I presented some of this work at the 71st annual meeting of the American Physical Society's [Division of Fluid Dynamics](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD18/Session/M16.1) in Atlanta, GA in November 2018, and at the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics' [symposium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMubzmWWRl5RkEdGKEX2yegpoHEUYuc1/view) on Vortex dynamics in science, nature and technology in San Diego, CA in June 2019.

## Forces due to exotic wakes
Vortex-dominated wakes can be effectively modeled as inifinte rows of point vortices embedded in an ideal flow. This not only gives us an elegant mathematical representation of a complex physical phenomenon, but also provides us with powerful analytical tools to study these systems.

I presented some of this work at the 72nd annual meeting of the American Physical Society's [Division of Fluid Dynamics](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD19/Session/C12.1) in Seattle, WA in November 2019.

## Interaction of vortex rings
I am working on the interaction of slender coaxial axisymmetric vortex rings propagating in an ideal fluid using a Hamiltonian formulation.
