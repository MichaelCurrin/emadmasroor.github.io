## Wakes of Oscillating Cylinders
I am working on an experimental study of the wake behind a cylinder oscillating perpedndicular to a uniform laminar flow. The experiments are conducted in a gravity-driven, inclined soap film channel which produces a two-dimensional flow that can be visualized with a high-speed camera.

I presented some of this work at the 71st annual meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics in Atlanta, GA in November 2018, and at the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics' symposium on Vortex dynamics in science, nature and technology in San Diego, CA in June 2019.

## Point Vortex modeling of Exotic Wakes
Vortex-dominated wakes can be effectively modeled as inifinte rows of point vortices embedded in an ideal flow. This not only gives us an elegant mathematical representation of a complex physical phenomenon, but also provides us with powerful analytical tools to study these systems.

For instance, I am using point vortex models to study the stability of vortex streets and the forces exerted on vortex-shedding bluff bodies.

## Side Projects

#### Computational Fluid Dynamics with Julia
I am working on a small finite-volume solver of the 2-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the newly-developed programming language, [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Julia is a versatile programming language that solves the "two-language problem" by combining the user-friendly syntax of Python/MATLAB with the low-level processing power of C++ and Fortran. I will be posting the associated code to Github once the project is complete.
