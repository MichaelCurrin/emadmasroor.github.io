## Wakes of Oscillating Cylinders
I am working on an experimental study of the wake behind a cylinder oscillating perpedndicular to a uniform laminar flow. The experiments are conducted in a gravity-driven, inclined soap film channel which produces a two-dimensional flow that can be visualized with a high-speed camera.
