[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a modern programming language developed for scientific computing. It combines the user-friendliness of high-level languages such as MATLAB and Python with the low-level optimization of legacy languages like C and FORTRAN. Although much of my workflow is tied up in proprietary tools like Mathematica and MATLAB, I think Julia is the language of the future, and I am actively transferring my workflow into Julia. 

The language has an exciting package ecosystem, maintained by developers all over the world. Everything is free and open source, allowing for the most widespread dissemination of knowledge and tools developed in the language, unlike in MATLAB or Mathematica where individuals or institutions must fork thousands (or millions) of dollars to use and maintain code written in proprietary ecosystems.
